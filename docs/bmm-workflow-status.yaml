# Workflow Status - InsureGraph Pro
# BMad Method Workflow Tracking

# This tracks progress through BMM methodology Analysis, Planning, and Solutioning phases.
# Implementation phase is tracked separately in sprint-status.yaml

# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Initial Status (before completion):
#   - required: Must be completed to progress
#   - optional: Can be completed but not required
#   - recommended: Strongly suggested but not required
#   - conditional: Required only if certain conditions met (e.g., if_has_ui)
#
# Completion Status:
#   - {file-path}: File created/found (e.g., "docs/product-brief.md")
#   - skipped: Optional/conditional workflow that was skipped

# Notes
notes: |
  프로젝트는 이미 PRD, Architecture, Epics 작업이 완료되었습니다.
  다음 단계는 implementation-readiness 검증 후 sprint-planning입니다.

  현재 구현된 Stories:
  - Backend: Story 1.0 ~ 3.5
  - Frontend: Story 1 ~ 6

  하지만 공식 BMM sprint-status.yaml이 없으므로 sprint-planning 워크플로우를 실행하여 생성해야 합니다.
